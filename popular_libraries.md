## [Config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/config) 
this package helps us define config variables, by default it is supposed to be present in a directory named `config` at the project root, it needs to have configuration environment files like `development.json`, `production.json`, `test.json` etc, the directory can be configured to something else and more advanced features exist for multi instance deployments etc. For choosing what config file to look into it looks at the `NODE_ENV` variable and if its `undefined`, it defaults to the value `development`
